## Purpose of Website

The main purpose of this website is to showcase to  recruiters from the IT industry my skills, education, projects, blogs and contact details for hiring purposes.

## Funcionality / features

The portfolio website was designed for an easy navigational experience. First thing user will notice is my logo which will be the brand of my services. Then a navigation bar right under it where user can click on the them for more information.

I added a picture of myself so the client can see who is dealing with. I believe I need to provide a sense of realibility and transparency from day one in order to build a long lasttime business relationship.
I also addded a small description of my services, contact details and social networks logos that will send the user directly to my socials profile.

- The navigation bar has a button named "resume" which will display my resume in PDF format so a potential client can download. The resume will contain more details about my work experience, education, projects and references.

- 4 main pages, the navigation bar with 5 buttons including the one directing user to my resume and the logo always at the top of page that leads to the homepage are the main features of the website.
